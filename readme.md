This is a basic project meant to showcase a handle on foundational concepts of HTML code for a website. home.html containts the home page, while the other files are 
placeholders and simply meant to showcase the ability to use a "nav" section and have multiple pages. If I were to continue to work on the file I would add .CSS styling and increased
functionality.
